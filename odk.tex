\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{sec:intro}

The number of children born on Kampala streets keeps on increasing every month. The number of child mothers is also on increase in Kampala.  At least over 10 pregnant mothers are picked from the streets of Kampala every month according to child rights activists.
The Managing Director of Dwelling places Rita Nkemba says many young girls ran away from their parents and come to beg on the streets of Kampala.

 She says these girlsâ€™ later gets pregnant on the streets yet they are unable to attend antenatal care. Nkemba says most of them are picked by good Samaritans and taken to Dwelling Places where they safely deliver healthy babies.

There are currently no specific systems in place, however, to register street children, who often lack adequate family care and protection making them a difficult group to reach. A tailored approach is therefore required to reach out to street children and to help them access birth registration.


\section{OBJECTIVES}
This project is aiming to work with children, local organisations and the Ugandan government to address this situation and to register street children through outreach registration services, in Kampala. The project is also working to raise awareness of birth registration among street children and their families or carers, with the aim to increase understanding of the importance of birth registration and the barriers that being unregistered can create. It is hoped that the Ugandan government will replicate the model with more Feature, so that thousands more street children can access birth registration, providing them with an official identity and, with this, the first step to claiming the rights they are entitled to.
